    <h2>
      4.1 Evaluation of Tracks
    </h2>
    <p>
      After landing, the recorded tracklog should be examined to determine the scoring distance flown. Here the start point, up to 3 turnpoints and the finish point are to be positioned on the tracklog to provide the greatest possible distance. A flight may be scored as a triangle, when the distance between start point and finish point is less than 20% of the entire distance as given by the 3 turnpoints. The scoring distance will then be given by the turnpoint distance, minus the gap (finish to start) distance.

    </p>
    <p>
      The scoring rule which gives the most points will always be used. All scoring results will be rounded to 2 decimal places. For valuation of each flight will be chosen from a such tracks, whose distance exceed the minimum distance.
    </p>
    <h2>
      4.3 Evaluating Flight Tracklog
    </h2>
    <p>
      After landing, the recorded tracklog should be transferred to a computer to the valid IGC file format. Once this has occurred, the IGC file should be uploaded to the XContest server to be entered in the scoring.

<p>7. Protests</p>
    </h1>

    <h2>
7.1. Protests due to non-acceptance of a flight
    </h2>
    <p>
Should a flight not be accepted by the organizer, then every pilot has the right to firstly register a complaint, and thereafter to enter a written protest against the decision.
    </p>
    <p>
Please send your complains to <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration: none;"> <a href="mailto:xcontest.india@gmail.com">xcontest.india@gmail.com</a> </span>
    </p>
    <p>
A protest must arrive no later than one week after the end of season. The jury is responsible for deciding if a protest is valid or not.
    </p>

    <h2>
7.2. Jury
    </h2>
    <p>
The jury is formed from organizers and makes the final decisions with regard to protests. No further appeals or legal actions are permitted.
    </p>
    <h1>
8. Technical Specification
    </h1>
    
    <p>
Every pilot is responsible for choosing his or her own recording instrument, logger or GPS. The pilot is responsible for recording a continual tracklog, correct transferral, evaluation uploading as an IGC File. Recorded tracklogs may only originate from a single instrument; tracks compiled from recordings from more than one instrument will not be accepted.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Should a logger split a continual flight into more than one tracklog, then the pilot should contact the manufacturer to rectify this problem. Manufacturers which certify their instruments as GNSS approved loggers(FR, flight recorder) comply with the FAI regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>
      8.1. GPS hardware recommendations
    </h2>
    <p>
The organizer makes no special recommendations regarding GPS hardware. Flight documentation performed viaGPS is fully equivalent to that performed with a GNSS-logger. The compatibility of a particular piece of GPS hardware is largely dependant on the supporting s oftware available for it.
    </p>

    <h2>
8.2. Recording interval
    </h2>
    <p>
A continuously recorded tracklog must have at least one position recording per minute – i.e. the maximum recording inter v al is 60 seconds. It is recommended that the tracklog recording interval be set between 5 and 15 seconds to reduce the chance of a 60 second interval with no position recordings occurring. Should a pilot intentionally switch off the GPS during a flight, this invalidates the tracklog.
    </p>

    <h2>
8.3. GPS failure
    </h2>
    <p>
GPS failures may result in one or more breaks in the tracklog longer than 60 seconds. One or two seperate GPS failures less than 15 minutes lon g within a tracklog will be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flights with GPS failures of longer than 15 minutes or more then two separate GPS failures will not be allowed for the registering and scoring.
